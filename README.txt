Formula 1 Race Prediction â€“ README

This project predicts the outcomes of Formula 1 races using machine learning, based on historical race data from 2020 to 2024. 
It generates win probabilities for each driver in the 2025 season and calculates final driver standings using the official F1 points 
system. The model uses a Random Forest Regressor and outputs both prediction plots and a summary of points standings.

How to Run the Project:
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended).

Install required libraries by running:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib joblib

Run the project by executing the main.py file:
python main.py

After execution, the terminal will show predicted win probabilities and final 2025 standings. 
Prediction plots will be saved in the plots folder.
